# x86reference

Quickly search x86 assembly operation reference. Documentation is extracted from
Intel's official x86 reference using the excellent
[zneak/x86doc](https://github.com/zneak/x86doc), then further parsed into
concise metadata using a modified version of `docenizer.py` (taken from
[here](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/blob/b3521cc1ec217db7294316dd919e86876575654a/etc/scripts/docenizer.py)).
