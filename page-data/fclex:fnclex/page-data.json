The FCLEX instruction checks for and handles any pending unmasked floating-point exceptions before clearing the exception flags; the FNCLEX instruction does not.</p><p>The assembler issues two instructions for the FCLEX instruction (an FWAIT instruction followed by an FNCLEX instruction), and the processor executes each of these instructions separately. If an exception is generated for either of these instructions, the save EIP points to the instruction that caused the exception.</p><p>When operating a Pentium or Intel486 processor in MS-DOS* compatibility mode, it is possible (under unusual circumstances) for an FNCLEX instruction to be interrupted prior to being executed to handle a pending FPU exception. See the section titled “No-Wait FPU Instructions Can Get FPU Interrupt in Window” in Appendix D of the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>, for a description of these circumstances. An FNCLEX instruction cannot be interrupted in this way on later Intel processors, except for the Intel Quark<sup>TM</sup> X1000 processor.</p><p>This instruction affects only the x87 FPU floating-point exception flags.
