The selected byte elements are written to the destination at byte granularity under the writemask k1.</p><p>The first and second operands are ZMM/YMM/XMM registers. The first operand contains input indices to select elements from the two input tables in the 2nd and 3rd operands. The first operand is also the destination of the result. The third operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, or a 512/256/128-bit memory location. In each index byte, the id bit for table selection is bit 6/5/4, and bits [5:0]/[4:0]/[3:0] selects element within each input table.</p><p>Note that these instructions permit a byte value in the source operands to be copied to more than one location in the destination operand. Also, the same tables can be reused in subsequent iterations, but the index elements are overwritten.</p><p>Bits (MAX_VL-1:256/128) of the destination are zeroed for VL=256,128.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VPERMI2B.html"}}},
