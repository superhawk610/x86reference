As the bits in the data elements are shifted left, the empty low-order bits are cleared (set to 0). If the value specified by the count operand is greater than 15 (for words), 31 (for doublewords), or 63 (for a quadword), then the destination operand is set to all 0s. <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/PSLLW:PSLLD:PSLLQ.html#fig-4-17\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Figure 4-17</a> gives an example of shifting words in a 64-bit operand.</p><p>The (V)PSLLW instruction shifts each of the words in the destination operand to the left by the number of bits specified in the count operand; the (V)PSLLD instruction shifts each of the doublewords in the destination operand; and the (V)PSLLQ instruction shifts the quadword (or quadwords) in the destination operand.</p><p>In 64-bit mode and not encoded with VEX/EVEX, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p><p>Legacy SSE instructions 64-bit operand: The destination operand is an MMX technology register; the count operand can be either an MMX technology register or an 64-bit memory location.</p><p>128-bit Legacy SSE version: The destination and first source operands are XMM registers. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. The count operand can be either an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location or an 8-bit immediate. If the count operand is a memory address, 128 bits are loaded but the upper 64 bits are ignored.</p><p>VEX.128 encoded version: The destination and first source operands are XMM registers. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination YMM register are zeroed. The count operand can be either an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location or an 8-bit immediate. If the count operand is a memory address, 128 bits are loaded but the upper 64 bits are ignored.</p><p>VEX.256 encoded version: The destination operand is a YMM register.

Bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the corresponding ZMM register are zeroed.</p><p>EVEX encoded versions: The destination operand is a ZMM register updated according to the writemask. The count operand is either an 8-bit immediate (the immediate count version) or an 8-bit value from an XMM register or a memory location (the variable count version). For the immediate count version, the source operand (the second operand) can be a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 32/64-bit memory location.
