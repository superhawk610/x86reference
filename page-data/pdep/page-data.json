PDEP takes the low bits from the first source operand and deposit them in the destination operand at the corresponding bit locations that are set in the second source operand (mask). All other bits (bits not set in mask) in destination are set to zero.</p><p>This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/PDEP.html"}}},
