The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; the source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the destination operand format.</p><p>The ADD instruction performs integer addition. It evaluates the result for both signed and unsigned integer operands and sets the CF and OF flags to indicate a carry (overflow) in the signed or unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the signed result.</p><p>This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the instructionâ€™s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/ADD.html"}}},
