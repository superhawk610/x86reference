The source operand can be register AL, AX, or EAX, depending on the size of the port being accessed (8, 16, or 32 bits, respectively); the destination operand can be a byte-immediate or the DX register. Using a byte immediate allows I/O port addresses 0 to 255 to be accessed; using the DX register as a source operand allows I/O ports from 0 to 65,535 to be accessed.</p><p>The size of the I/O port being accessed is determined by the opcode for an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attribute of the instruction for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port.</p><p>At the machine code level, I/O instructions are shorter when accessing 8-bit I/O ports. Here, the upper eight bits of the port address will be 0.</p><p>This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor’s I/O address space. See Chapter 18, “Input/Output,” in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>, for more information on accessing I/O ports in the I/O address space.</p><p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p><p>After executing an OUT instruction, the Pentium<em><sup>® </sup></em>processor ensures that the EWBE# pin has been sampled active before it begins to execute the next instruction. (Note that the instruction can be prefetched if EWBE# is not active, but it will not be executed until the EWBE# pin is sampled active.) Only the Pentium processor family has the EWBE# pin.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/OUT.html"}}},
