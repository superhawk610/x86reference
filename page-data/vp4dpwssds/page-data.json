The memory operand is sequentially selected in each of the four steps.</p><p>In the above box, the notation of “+3” is used to denote that the instruction accesses 4 source registers based on that operand; sources are consecutive, start in a multiple of 4 boundary, and contain the encoded register operand.</p><p>This instruction supports memory fault suppression. The entire memory operand is loaded if any bit of the lowest 16-bits of the mask is set to 1 or if a “no masking” encoding is used.</p><p>The tuple type Tuple1_4X implies that four 32-bit elements (16 bytes) are referenced by the memory operation portion of this instruction.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VP4DPWSSDS.html"}}},
