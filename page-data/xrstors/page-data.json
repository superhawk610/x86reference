The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components restored correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and the logical-OR of XCR0 with the IA32_XSS MSR. XRSTORS may be executed only if CPL = 0.</p><p>The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>. Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends on a REX.W prefix; see Section 13.5.1, “x87 State” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>.</p><p>Section 13.12, “Operation of XRSTORS,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> provides a detailed description of the operation of the XRSTOR instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p><p>Use of a source operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (for 64-bit and 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p><p>See Section 13.6, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> for discussion of the bitmaps XINUSE and XMODIFIED and of the quantity XRSTOR_INFO.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/XRSTORS.html"}}},
