The maximum relative error for this approximation is less than 2<sup>-14</sup>.</p><p>EVEX.512 encoded version: The source operand can be a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location, or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.</p><p>EVEX.256 encoded version: The source operand is a YMM register, a 256-bit memory location, or a 256-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.</p><p>EVEX.128 encoded version: The source operand is a XMM register, a 128-bit memory location, or a 128-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a XMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.</p><p>The VRSQRT14PD instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ with the sign of the source value is returned. When the source operand is an +∞ then +ZERO value is returned. A denormal source value is treated as zero only if DAZ bit is set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated correctly and performs the approximation with the specified masked response. When a source value is a negative value (other than 0.0) a floating-point QNaN_indefinite is returned. When a source value is an SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.</p><p>MXCSR exception flags are not affected by this instruction and floating-point exceptions are not reported.</p><p>Note: EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VRSQRT14PD.html"}}},
