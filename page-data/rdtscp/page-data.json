The EDX register is loaded with the high-order 32 bits of the IA32_TSC MSR; the EAX register is loaded with the low-order 32 bits of the IA32_TSC MSR; and the ECX register is loaded with the low-order 32-bits of IA32_TSC_AUX MSR. On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the high-order 32 bits of each of RAX, RDX, and RCX are cleared.</p><p>The processor monotonically increments the time-stamp counter MSR every clock cycle and resets it to 0 whenever the processor is reset. See “Time Stamp Counter” in Chapter 17 of the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B</em>, for specific details of the time stamp counter behavior.</p><p>The time stamp disable (TSD) flag in register CR4 restricts the use of the RDTSCP instruction as follows. When the flag is clear, the RDTSCP instruction can be executed at any privilege level; when the flag is set, the instruction can only be executed at privilege level 0.</p><p>The RDTSCP instruction is not a serializing instruction, but it does wait until all previous instructions have executed and all previous loads are globally visible.<sup>1</sup> But it does not wait for previous stores to be globally visible, and subsequent instructions may begin execution before the read operation is performed.
