They are used for managing the enclaves."},"text":"<p>The ENCLV instruction invokes the virtualization SGX leaf functions for managing enclaves in a virtualized environment. Software specifies the leaf function by setting the appropriate value in the register EAX as input. The registers RBX, RCX, and RDX have leaf-specific purpose, and may act as input, as output, or may be unused. In non 64-bit mode, the instruction ignores upper 32 bits of the RAX register.</p><p>The ENCLV instruction produces an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) if CR0.PE = 0 or RFLAGS.VM = 1, if it is executed in system-management mode (SMM), or not in VMX operation. Additionally, any attempt to execute the instruction when CPL &gt; 0 results in #UD. The instruction produces a general-protection exception (#GP) if CR0.PG = 0 or if an attempt is made to invoke an undefined leaf function.</p><p>Software in VMX root mode of operation can enable execution of the ENCLV instruction in VMX non-root mode by setting enable ENCLV execution control in the VMCS. If enable ENCLV execution control in the VMCS is clear, execution of the ENCLV instruction in VMX non-root mode results in #UD.</p><p>When execution of ENCLV instruction in VMX non-root mode is enabled, software in VMX root operation can intercept the invocation of various ENCLV leaf functions in VMX non-root operation by setting the corresponding bits in the ENCLV-exiting bitmap.</p><p>Addresses and operands are 32 bits in 32-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA == 0 || CS.L == 0) and are 64 bits in 64-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA == 1 &amp;&amp; CS.L == 1). CS.D value has no impact on address calculation.</p><p>Segment override prefixes and address-size override prefixes are ignored, as is the REX prefix in 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/ENCLV.html"}}},
