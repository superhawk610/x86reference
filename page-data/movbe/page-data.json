The source operand can be a general-purpose register, or memory location; the destination register can be a general-purpose register, or a memory location; however, both operands can not be registers, and only one operand can be a memory location. Both operands must be the same size, which can be a word, a doubleword or quadword.</p><p>The MOVBE instruction is provided for swapping the bytes on a read from memory or on a write to memory; thus providing support for converting little-endian values to big-endian format and vice versa.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.
