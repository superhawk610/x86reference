Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends on a REX.W prefix; see Section 13.5.1, “x87 State” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>.</p><p>Section 13.7, “Operation of XSAVE,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> provides a detailed description of the operation of the XSAVE instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p><p>Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit or 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/XSAVE.html"}}},
