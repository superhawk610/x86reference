The source operand is an XMM register, YMM register or ZMM register, which is assumed to contain integer data (packed bytes, words, double-words, or quadwords). The destination operand is a 128-bit, 256-bit or 512-bit memory location. The memory operand must be aligned on a 16-byte (128-bit version), 32-byte (VEX.256 encoded version) or 64-byte (512-bit version) boundary otherwise a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated.</p><p>The non-temporal hint is implemented by using a write combining (WC) memory type protocol when writing the data to memory. Using this protocol, the processor does not write the data into the cache hierarchy, nor does it fetch the corresponding cache line from memory into the cache hierarchy. The memory type of the region being written to can override the non-temporal hint, if the memory address specified for the non-temporal store is in an uncacheable (UC) or write protected (WP) memory region. For more information on non-temporal stores, see “Caching of Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data” in Chapter 10 in the IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.</p><p>Because the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model, a fencing operation implemented with the SFENCE or MFENCE instruction should be used in conjunction with VMOVNTDQ instructions if multiple processors might use different memory types to read/write the destination memory locations.</p><p>Note: VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b, VEX.L must be 0; otherwise instructions will #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MOVNTDQ.html"}}},
