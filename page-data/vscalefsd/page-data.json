The overflow and underflow responses are dependent on the rounding mode (for IEEE-compliant rounding), as well as on other settings in MXCSR (exception mask bits, FTZ bit), and on the SAE bit.</p><p>EVEX encoded version: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or a memory location.
