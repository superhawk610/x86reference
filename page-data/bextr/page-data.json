Bit 7:0 of the second source operand specifies the starting bit position of bit extraction. A START value exceeding the operand size will not extract any bits from the second source operand. Bit 15:8 of the second source operand specifies the maximum number of bits (LENGTH) beginning at the START position to extract. Only bit positions up to (OperandSize -1) of the first source operand are extracted. The extracted bits are written to the destination register, starting from the least significant bit. All higher order bits in the destination operand (starting at bit position LENGTH) are zeroed. The destination register is cleared if no bits are extracted.</p><p>This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/BEXTR.html"}}},
