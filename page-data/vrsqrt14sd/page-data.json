When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ with the sign of the source value is returned. When the source operand is an +∞ then +ZERO value is returned. A denormal source value is treated as zero only if DAZ bit is set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated correctly and performs the approximation with the specified masked response. When a source value is a negative value (other than 0.0) a floating-point QNaN_indefinite is returned. When a source value is an SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.</p><p>MXCSR exception flags are not affected by this instruction and floating-point exceptions are not reported.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VRSQRT14SD.html"}}},
