The destination and source operands are floating-point values located in registers ST(0) and ST(1), respectively. This instruction provides rapid multiplication or division by integral powers of 2. The following table shows the results obtained when scaling various classes of numbers, assuming that neither overflow nor underflow occurs.</p><p>In most cases, only the exponent is changed and the mantissa (significand) remains unchanged. However, when the value being scaled in ST(0) is a denormal value, the mantissa is also changed and the result may turn out to be a normalized number. Similarly, if overflow or underflow results from a scale operation, the resulting mantissa will differ from the sourceâ€™s mantissa.</p><p>The FSCALE instruction can also be used to reverse the action of the FXTRACT instruction, as shown in the following example:</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/FSCALE.html"}}},
