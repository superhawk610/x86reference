The instruction then issues a special-function bus cycle that directs external caches to also write back modified data and another bus cycle to indicate that the external caches should be invalidated.</p><p>After executing this instruction, the processor does not wait for the external caches to complete their write-back and flushing operations before proceeding with instruction execution. It is the responsibility of hardware to respond to the cache write-back and flush signals. The amount of time or cycles for WBINVD to complete will vary due to size and other factors of different cache hierarchies. As a consequence, the use of the WBINVD instruction can have an impact on logical processor interrupt/event response time. Additional information of WBINVD behavior in a cache hierarchy with hierarchical sharing topology can be found in Chapter 2 of the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A</em>.</p><p>The WBINVD instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor is running in protected mode, the CPL of a program or procedure must be 0 to execute this instruction. This instruction is also a serializing instruction (see “Serializing Instructions” in Chapter 8 of the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A</em>).</p><p>In situations where cache coherency with main memory is not a concern, software can use the INVD instruction.</p><p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p><p>The WBINVD instruction is implementation dependent, and its function may be implemented differently on future Intel 64 and IA-32 processors. The instruction is not supported on IA-32 processors earlier than the Intel486 processor.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/WBINVD.html"}}},
