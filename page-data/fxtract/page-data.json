Following this operation, the new top-of-stack register ST(0) contains the value of the original significand expressed as a floating-point value. The sign and significand of this value are the same as those found in the source operand, and the exponent is 3FFFH (biased value for a true exponent of zero). The ST(1) register contains the value of the original operand’s true (unbiased) exponent expressed as a floating-point value. (The operation performed by this instruction is a superset of the IEEE-recommended logb(<em>x</em>) function.)</p><p>This instruction and the F2XM1 instruction are useful for performing power and range scaling operations. The FXTRACT instruction is also useful for converting numbers in double extended-precision floating-point format to decimal representations (e.g., for printing or displaying).</p><p>If the floating-point zero-divide exception (#Z) is masked and the source operand is zero, an exponent value of –∞ is stored in register ST(1) and 0 with the sign of the source operand is stored in register ST(0).</p><p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/FXTRACT.html"}}},
