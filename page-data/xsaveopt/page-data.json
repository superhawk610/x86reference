The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask.

Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends on a REX.W prefix; see Section 13.5.1, “x87 State” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>.</p><p>Section 13.9, “Operation of XSAVEOPT,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> provides a detailed description of the operation of the XSAVEOPT instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p><p>Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit or 32-bit modes) will result in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p><p>See Section 13.6, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> for discussion of the bitmap XMODIFIED and of the quantity XRSTOR_INFO.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/XSAVEOPT.html"}}},
