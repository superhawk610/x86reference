Bits (127:64) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source operand (the second operand). The maximum relative error for this approximation is less than 2<sup>-14</sup>. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register.</p><p>The VRCP14SD instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an âˆž with the sign of the source value is returned. A denormal source value will be treated as zero only in case of DAZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated correctly (i.e. not as a 0.0). Underflow results are flushed to zero only in case of FTZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it will be treated correctly (i.e. correct underflow result is written) with the sign of the operand. When a source value is a SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.
