The destination operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location.</p><p>In non-64-bit modes, when the destination operand is a 32-bit register, the low-order 16 bits of register CR0 are copied into the low-order 16 bits of the register and the high-order 16 bits are undefined. When the destination operand is a memory location, the low-order 16 bits of register CR0 are written to memory as a 16-bit quantity, regardless of the operand size.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the behavior of the SMSW instruction is defined by the following examples:</p><p>SMSW is only useful in operating-system software. However, it is not a privileged instruction and can be used in application programs if CR4.UMIP = 0. It is provided for compatibility with the Intel 286 processor. Programs and procedures intended to run on IA-32 and Intel 64 processors beginning with the Intel386 processors should use the MOV CR instruction to load the machine status word.</p><p>See “Changes to Instruction Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation” in Chapter 25 of the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C</em>, for more information about the behavior of this instruction in VMX non-root operation.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/SMSW.html"}}},
