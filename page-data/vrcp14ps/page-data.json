The maximum relative error for this approximation is less than 2<sup>-14</sup>.</p><p>The source operand can be a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM register conditionally updated according to the writemask.</p><p>The VRCP14PS instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an âˆž with the sign of the source value is returned. A denormal source value will be treated as zero only in case of DAZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated correctly (i.e. not as a 0.0). Underflow results are flushed to zero only in case of FTZ bit set in MXCSR. Otherwise it will be treated correctly (i.e. correct underflow result is written) with the sign of the operand. When a source value is a SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.</p><p>EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.</p><p>MXCSR exception flags are not affected by this instruction and floating-point exceptions are not reported.</p><p>* in this case the mantissa is shifted right by one or two bits</p><p>A numerically exact implementation of VRCP14xx can be found at:</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VRCP14PS.html"}}},
