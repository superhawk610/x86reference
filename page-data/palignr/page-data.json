The first and the second operands can be an MMX,</p><p>XMM or a YMM register. The immediate value is considered unsigned. Immediate shift counts larger than the 2L (i.e. 32 for 128-bit operands, or 16 for 64-bit operands) produce a zero result. Both operands can be MMX registers, XMM registers or YMM registers. When the source operand is a 128-bit memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated.</p><p>In 64-bit mode and not encoded by VEX/EVEX prefix, use the REX prefix to access additional registers.</p><p>128-bit Legacy SSE version: Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged.</p><p>EVEX.512 encoded version: The first source operand is a ZMM register and contains four 16-byte blocks. The second source operand is a ZMM register or a 512-bit memory location containing four 16-byte block. The destination operand is a ZMM register and contain four 16-byte results. The imm8[7:0] is the common shift count</p><p>used for each of the four successive 16-byte block sources. The low 16-byte block of the two source operands produce the low 16-byte result of the destination operand, the high 16-byte block of the two source operands produce the high 16-byte result of the destination operand and so on for the blocks in the middle.</p><p>VEX.256 and EVEX.256 encoded versions: The first source operand is a YMM register and contains two 16-byte blocks. The second source operand is a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location containing two 16-byte block. The destination operand is a YMM register and contain two 16-byte results. The imm8[7:0] is the common shift count used for the two lower 16-byte block sources and the two upper 16-byte block sources. The low 16-byte block of the two source operands produce the low 16-byte result of the destination operand, the high 16-byte block of the two source operands produce the high 16-byte result of the destination operand. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are zeroed.</p><p>VEX.128 and EVEX.128 encoded versions: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are zeroed.</p><p>Concatenation is done with 128-bit data in the first and second source operand for both 128-bit and 256-bit instructions. The high 128-bits of the intermediate composite 256-bit result came from the 128-bit data from the first source operand; the low 128-bits of the intermediate result came from the 128-bit data of the second source operand.</p><p>Note: VEX.L must be 0, otherwise the instruction will #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/PALIGNR.html"}}},
