The other logical processors in the physical processor remain active, unless they are each individually halted by executing a HLT instruction.</p><p>The HLT instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor is running in protected or virtual-8086 mode, the privilege level of a program or procedure must be 0 to execute the HLT instruction.</p><p>This instructionâ€™s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/HLT.html"}}},
