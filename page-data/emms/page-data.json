If a floating-point instruction loads one of the registers in the x87 FPU data register stack before the x87 FPU tag word has been reset by the EMMS instruction, an x87 floating-point register stack overflow can occur that will result in an x87 floating-point exception or incorrect result.</p><p>EMMS operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/EMMS.html"}}},
