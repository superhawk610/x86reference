This state data is typically written to the specified memory location by a previous FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.</p><p>The FPU operating environment consists of the FPU control word, status word, tag word, instruction pointer, data pointer, and last opcode. Figures 8-9 through 8-12 in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>, show the layout in memory of the stored environment, depending on the operating mode of the processor (protected or real) and the current operand-size attribute (16-bit or 32-bit). In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layouts are used. The contents of the FPU register stack are stored in the 80 bytes immediately following the operating environment image.</p><p>The FRSTOR instruction should be executed in the same operating mode as the corresponding FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.</p><p>If one or more unmasked exception bits are set in the new FPU status word, a floating-point exception will be generated. To avoid raising exceptions when loading a new operating environment, clear all the exception flags in the FPU status word that is being loaded.</p><p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/FRSTOR.html"}}},
