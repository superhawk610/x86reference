The source operand can be a byte-immediate or the DX register; the destination operand can be register AL, AX, or EAX, depending on the size of the port being accessed (8, 16, or 32 bits, respectively). Using the DX register as a source operand allows I/O port addresses from 0 to 65,535 to be accessed; using a byte immediate allows I/O port addresses 0 to 255 to be accessed.</p><p>When accessing an 8-bit I/O port, the opcode determines the port size; when accessing a 16- and 32-bit I/O port, the operand-size attribute determines the port size. At the machine code level, I/O instructions are shorter when accessing 8-bit I/O ports. Here, the upper eight bits of the port address will be 0.</p><p>This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor’s I/O address space. See Chapter 18, “Input/Output,” in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>, for more information on accessing I/O ports in the I/O address space.</p><p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/IN.html"}}},
