The source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a general-purpose register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the double-precision floating-point value is contained in the low quadword of the register.</p><p>When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. If a converted result cannot be represented in the destination format, the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the integer value 2<sup>w</sup> â€“ 1 is returned, where w represents the number of bits in the destination format.</p><p>EVEX.W1 version: promotes the instruction to produce 64-bit data in 64-bit mode.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VCVTTSD2USI.html"}}},
