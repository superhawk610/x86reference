The overflow and underflow responses are dependent on the rounding mode (for IEEE-compliant rounding), as well as on other settings in MXCSR (exception mask bits, FTZ bit), and on the SAE bit.</p><p>The first source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The second source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register conditionally updated with writemask k1.</p><p>Handling of special-case input values are listed in <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VSCALEFPD.html#tbl-5-30\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Table 5-30</a> and <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VSCALEFPD.html#tbl-5-31\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Table 5-31</a>.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/VSCALEFPD.html"}}},
