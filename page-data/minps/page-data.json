If a value in the second operand is an SNaN, then SNaN is forwarded unchanged to the destination (that is, a QNaN version of the SNaN is not returned).</p><p>If only one value is a NaN (SNaN or QNaN) for this instruction, the second operand (source operand), either a NaN or a valid floating-point value, is written to the result. If instead of this behavior, it is required that the NaN source operand (from either the first or second operand) be returned, the action of MINPS can be emulated using a sequence of instructions, such as, a comparison followed by AND, ANDN and OR.</p><p>EVEX encoded versions: The first source operand (the second operand) is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The second source operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register conditionally updated with writemask k1.</p><p>VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are zeroed.</p><p>VEX.128 encoded version: The first source operand is a XMM register. The second source operand can be a XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is a XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are zeroed.</p><p>128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM register destination are unmodified.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MINPS.html"}}},
