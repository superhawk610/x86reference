This enables efficient programming where the software can interleave add with carry operations and multiplications.</p><p>If the first and second operand are identical, it will contain the high half of the multiplication result.</p><p>This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/MULX.html"}}},
