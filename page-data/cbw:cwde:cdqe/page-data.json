The CBW (convert byte to word) instruction copies the sign (bit 7) in the source operand into every bit in the AH register. The CWDE (convert word to double-word) instruction copies the sign (bit 15) of the word in the AX register into the high 16 bits of the EAX register.</p><p>CBW and CWDE reference the same opcode. The CBW instruction is intended for use when the operand-size attribute is 16; CWDE is intended for use when the operand-size attribute is 32. Some assemblers may force the operand size. Others may treat these two mnemonics as synonyms (CBW/CWDE) and use the setting of the operand-size attribute to determine the size of values to be converted.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the default operation size is the size of the destination register. Use of the REX.W prefix promotes this instruction (CDQE when promoted) to operate on 64-bit operands. In which case, CDQE copies the sign (bit 31) of the doubleword in the EAX register into the high 32 bits of RAX.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/CBW%3ACWDE%3ACDQE.html"}}},
