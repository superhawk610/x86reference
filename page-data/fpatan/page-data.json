The result in register ST(0) has the same sign as the source operand ST(1) and a magnitude less than +π.</p><p>The FPATAN instruction returns the angle between the X axis and the line from the origin to the point (X,Y), where Y (the ordinate) is ST(1) and X (the abscissa) is ST(0). The angle depends on the sign of X and Y independently, not just on the sign of the ratio Y/X. This is because a point (−X,Y) is in the second quadrant, resulting in an angle between π/2 and π, while a point (X,−Y) is in the fourth quadrant, resulting in an angle between 0 and −π/2. A point (−X,−Y) is in the third quadrant, giving an angle between −π/2 and −π.</p><p>The following table shows the results obtained when computing the arctangent of various classes of numbers, assuming that underflow does not occur.</p><p>There is no restriction on the range of source operands that FPATAN can accept.</p><p>This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p><p>The source operands for this instruction are restricted for the 80287 math coprocessor to the following range:</p><p>0 ≤ |ST(1)| &lt; |ST(0)| &lt; +∞</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/FPATAN.html"}}},
