This instruction is provided for converting little-endian values to big-endian format and vice versa. To swap bytes in a word value (16-bit register), use the XCHG instruction. When the BSWAP instruction references a 16-bit register, the result is undefined.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the instructionâ€™s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.</p><p>The BSWAP instruction is not supported on IA-32 processors earlier than the Intel486TM processor family. For compatibility with this instruction, software should include functionally equivalent code for execution on Intel processors earlier than the Intel486 processor family.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/BSWAP.html"}}},
