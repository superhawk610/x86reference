The result is stored in the low quadword of the destination operand, and the high quadword left unchanged. When conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register.</p><p>The second source operand can be a general-purpose register or a 32/64-bit memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers.</p><p>128-bit Legacy SSE version: Use of the REX.W prefix promotes the instruction to 64-bit operands. The “convert-from” source operand (the second operand) is a general-purpose register or memory location. The destination is an XMM register Bits (MAXVL-1:64) of the corresponding destination register remain unchanged.</p><p>VEX.128 and EVEX encoded versions: The “convert-from” source operand (the third operand) can be a general-purpose register or a memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. Bits (127:64) of the XMM register destination are copied from the corresponding bits in the first source operand. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination register are zeroed.</p><p>EVEX.W0 version: attempt to encode this instruction with EVEX embedded rounding is ignored.</p><p>VEX.W1 and EVEX.W1 versions: promotes the instruction to use 64-bit input value in 64-bit mode.</p><p>Software should ensure VCVTSI2SD is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VCVTSI2SD with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/CVTSI2SD.html"}}},
