The bit base operand can be a register or a memory location; the bit offset operand can be a register or an immediate value:</p><p>See also: <strong>Bit(BitBase, BitOffset)</strong> on page 3-11.</p><p>Some assemblers support immediate bit offsets larger than 31 by using the immediate bit offset field in combination with the displacement field of the memory operand. See “BT—Bit Test” in this chapter for more information on this addressing mechanism.</p><p>This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
