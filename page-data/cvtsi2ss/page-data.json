The “convert-from” source operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The result is stored in the low doubleword of the destination operand, and the upper three doublewords are left unchanged. When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register or the embedded rounding control bits.</p><p>128-bit Legacy SSE version: In 64-bit mode, Use of the REX.W prefix promotes the instruction to use 64-bit input value. The “convert-from” source operand (the second operand) is a general-purpose register or memory location. Bits (MAXVL-1:32) of the corresponding destination register remain unchanged.</p><p>VEX.128 and EVEX encoded versions: The “convert-from” source operand (the third operand) can be a general-purpose register or a memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. Bits (127:32) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source operand. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination register are zeroed.</p><p>EVEX encoded version: the converted result in written to the low doubleword element of the destination under the writemask.</p><p>Software should ensure VCVTSI2SS is encoded with VEX.L=0.
