The source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location; the destination operand can be a register or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) Each bit of the result is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different; each bit is 0 if the corresponding bits are the same.</p><p>This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
