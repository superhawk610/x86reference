The second source operand (third operand) can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location. The result is stored in the low 32 bits of the destination operand; bits 128:32 of the destination operand are copied from the first source operand.

These comparisons can be made either</p><p>by using the inverse relationship (that is, use the “not-less-than-or-equal” to make a “greater-than” comparison) or by using software emulation. When using software emulation, the program must swap the operands (copying registers when necessary to protect the data that will now be in the destination), and then perform the compare using a different predicate. The predicate to be used for these emulations is listed in the first 8 rows of <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/CLI.html#tbl-3-7\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Table 3-7</a> (<em>Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual Volume 2A</em>) under the heading Emulation.</p><p>Compilers and assemblers may implement the following two-operand pseudo-ops in addition to the three-operand CMPSS instruction, for processors with “CPUID.1H:ECX.AVX =0”.

Compilers and assemblers may implement the following three-operand pseudo-ops in addition to the four-operand VCMPSS instruction. See <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/CMPSS.html#tbl-3-9\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Table 3-9</a>, where the notations of reg1 reg2, and reg3 represent either XMM registers or YMM registers. Compiler should treat reserved Imm8 values as illegal syntax. Alternately, intrinsics can map the pseudo-ops to pre-defined constants to support a simpler intrinsic interface. Compilers and assemblers may implement three-operand pseudo-ops for EVEX encoded VCMPSS instructions in a similar fashion by extending the syntax listed in <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/CMPSS.html#tbl-3-9\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Table 3-9</a>.</p><p>Software should ensure VCMPSS is encoded with VEX.L=0.
