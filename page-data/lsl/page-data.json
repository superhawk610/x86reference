The source operand (which can be a register or a memory location) contains the segment selector for the segment descriptor being accessed. The destination operand is a general-purpose register.</p><p>The processor performs access checks as part of the loading process. Once loaded in the destination register, software can compare the segment limit with the offset of a pointer.</p><p>The segment limit is a 20-bit value contained in bytes 0 and 1 and in the first 4 bits of byte 6 of the segment descriptor. If the descriptor has a byte granular segment limit (the granularity flag is set to 0), the destination operand is loaded with a byte granular value (byte limit). If the descriptor has a page granular segment limit (the granularity flag is set to 1), the LSL instruction will translate the page granular limit (page limit) into a byte limit before loading it into the destination operand. The translation is performed by shifting the 20-bit “raw” limit left 12 bits and filling the low-order 12 bits with 1s.</p><p>When the operand size is 32 bits, the 32-bit byte limit is stored in the destination operand. When the operand size is 16 bits, a valid 32-bit limit is computed; however, the upper 16 bits are truncated and only the low-order 16 bits are loaded into the destination operand.</p><p>This instruction performs the following checks before it loads the segment limit into the destination register:</p><p>If the segment descriptor cannot be accessed or is an invalid type for the instruction, the ZF flag is cleared and no value is loaded in the destination operand.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/LSL.html"}}},
