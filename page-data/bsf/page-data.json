If a least significant 1 bit is found, its bit index is stored in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be a register or a memory location; the destination operand is a register. The bit index is an unsigned offset from bit 0 of the source operand. If the content of the source operand is 0, the content of the destination operand is undefined.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the instructionâ€™s default operation size is 32 bits.
