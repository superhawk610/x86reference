The comparison is performed by subtracting the second operand from the first operand and then setting the status flags in the same manner as the SUB instruction. When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the first operand.</p><p>The condition codes used by the J<em>cc</em>, CMOV<em>cc</em>, and SET<em>cc</em> instructions are based on the results of a CMP instruction. Appendix B, “EFLAGS Condition Codes,” in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>, shows the relationship of the status flags and the condition codes.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.
