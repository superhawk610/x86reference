The source operand (the second operand) can be a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location, or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location.</p><p>The rounding process rounds the input to an integral value, plus number bits of fraction that are specified by imm8[7:4] (to be included in the result) and returns the result as a single-precision floating-point value.</p><p>It should be noticed that no overflow is induced while executing this instruction (although the source is scaled by the imm8[7:4] value).</p><p>The immediate operand also specifies control fields for the rounding operation, three bit fields are defined and shown in the “Immediate Control Description” figure below. Bit 3 of the immediate byte controls the processor behavior for a precision exception, bit 2 selects the source of rounding mode control. Bits 1:0 specify a non-sticky rounding-mode value (Immediate control table below lists the encoded values for rounding-mode field).</p><p>The Precision Floating-Point Exception is signaled according to the immediate operand. If any source operand is an SNaN then it will be converted to a QNaN.
