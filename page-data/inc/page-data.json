The destination operand can be a register or a memory location. This instruction allows a loop counter to be updated without disturbing the CF flag.

Otherwise, the instructionâ€™s 64-bit mode default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/INC.html"}}},
