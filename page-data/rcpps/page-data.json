The source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. See <span class=\"not-imported\">Figure 10-5</span> in the <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>, for an illustration of a SIMD single-precision floating-point operation.</p><p>The relative error for this approximation is:</p><p>|Relative Error| ≤ 1.5 ∗ 2<sup>−12</sup></p><p>The RCPPS instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ of the sign of the source value is returned. A denormal source value is treated as a 0.0 (of the same sign). Tiny results (see Section 4.9.1.5, “Numeric Underflow Exception (#U)” in <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em>) are always flushed to 0.0, with the sign of the operand. (Input values greater than or equal to |1.11111111110100000000000B∗2<sup>125</sup>| are guaranteed to not produce tiny results; input values less than or equal to |1.00000000000110000000001B*2<sup>126</sup>| are guaranteed to produce tiny results, which are in turn flushed to 0.0; and input values in between this range may or may not produce tiny results, depending on the implementation.) When a source value is an SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p><p>128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location.

The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are zeroed.</p><p>VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.</p><p>Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/RCPPS.html"}}},
