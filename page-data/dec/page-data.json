The destination operand can be a register or a memory location. This instruction allows a loop counter to be updated without disturbing the CF flag. (To perform a decrement operation that updates the CF flag, use a SUB instruction with an immediate operand of 1.)</p><p>This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.</p><p>In 64-bit mode, DEC r16 and DEC r32 are not encodable (because opcodes 48H through 4FH are REX prefixes). Otherwise, the instructionâ€™s 64-bit mode default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.</p><p>See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.</p>","href":"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/DEC.html"}}},
